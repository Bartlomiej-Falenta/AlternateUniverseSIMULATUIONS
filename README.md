# AlternateUniverseSIMULATUIONS
Attempts at simulating alternate physics, where speed of light **is not** constant, but its wavelength is.
Simulations are merely thought experiment and **should not** be treated as an actual alternative formulation or anything.
So far they include thermodynamics, optics, electrodynamics, general relativity – not sure if more will appear.

Basically, Flatland-like considerations, but I have basic Python skills to „test” them.
